POC of a a due-dilligance and initial safety check to assess a solidity smart-contract prior to user interaction.The goal would be to have it as a browser extension to catch up transaction request prior for them to be validated by the user so they can review and decide weither they want to interact with it. The idea behind it was to make it user-friendly to interact with such information without relying on the user to manually go to different resources to validate a smart contract prior to interacting with it, wheither or not you are developper. It would be ideal that the tool act with basic scoring and/or YES/NO checks which are easy for the user to understand and to watch out for.
